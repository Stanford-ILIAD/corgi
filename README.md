## Interface
We provide code for user study interfaces to aid reproducibility of our experiment. Specifically:
* ```interfaces/teaching-interface/``` contains source code for the learning gain experiment for the Drawing task
* Other interfaces: Coming soon! 


## Data
We provide data used to train CORGI. Specifically:
* ```data/data.json``` contains the raw crowdsourced data without any data augmentation
* ```data/resources/``` contains gif files corresponding to movements shown during crowdsourcing for entries in ```data.json```

## Environments
Coming soon!

## Model 
Coming soon!
